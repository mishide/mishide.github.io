Data scientist who excels at data wrangling, machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations.    

Extensive healthcare domain experince including:  hospital, pharmaceutical, R&D.  

References have referred to me as tenacious, hard-working, and a leader.  Executives trust my input on technical impacts, realistic expectations, and remember me for my ability to quickly find paths around roadblocks during project development and adressing technical issues.

I enjoy working on projects together so feel free to contact me for collaboration.
